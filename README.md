# Create a Contact Book app

Create a simple Contact Book app that allows user to manage a collection of friends’ contact details.

For each Person, the user should be able to save the name and city where they live.
All contact details should be displayed on one page, as person “cards”.

Next to each person, show two buttons:

- an “Edit” button; when clicked, only that Person becomes editable
- a “Delete” button, which will delete the contact

Build your solution using React with Typescript.
Use only the default React hooks (no need to add any libraries).

## Getting started with this repo
